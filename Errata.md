Here is how we define the cells:
* **TP (true positives)**: These are located in the `lower-right cell`, containing examples that have been correctly predicted as positive ones.
* **FP (false positives)**: These are located in the `upper-right cell`, containing examples that have been predicted as positive but are actually negative.
* **FN (false negatives)**: These are located in the `lower-left cell`, containing examples that have been predicted as negative but are actually positive.
* **TN (true negatives)**: These are located in the `upper-left cell`, containing examples that have been correctly predicted as negative ones.

change "only 1,495" to "about 24,500"

## Chapter 06, Page no 184, feature_19 and feature_54

Instead of feature_19 and feature_54, the correct features, that appear the most different between the training/test split, are cont14, cont4 and cont5.
